# Facebook discord emojis

## Installation
The simple installation outside of a package is to simply npm install then add the folder into your google chrome extensions via developer mode.

## Usage
Similar to discord, you simply write :[COMMAND]:, which the code then replaces with an emoji.

So, you lucky people can do 'How the hell does this work? : thinking:' which will then be replaced with 'How the hell does this work? ðŸ¤”'.

## Notes
Thanks to [http://stackoverflow.com/users/96100/tim-down](Tim Down) on Stack Overflow for the pasteHtmlAtCaret code.

Had to add a space on the : thinking: because.. Git has discord style emojis now. God damnit.
